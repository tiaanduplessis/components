## Primer React

Primer React is a React implementation of GitHub's [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/) ðŸŽ‰

## Principles

* Everything is a component.
* Aim for total style encapsulation; don't rely on inheritance to provide default styles.
* Build small building blocks with minimal props to keep complexity low.
* Keep system constrained by only including props needed per component.
* Favor wrapping or extending components for more complex operations.
* Maintain design system consistency with utilities as props (for spacing, color, font-size, line-height, widths, and radii).
